# Explanation:
# 1. Parse the URL: Extract the host and path from the URL.
# 2. Create a Socket: Create a socket object using socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_STREAM.
# 3. Connect to the Server: Connect to the server on port 80 (HTTP).
# 4. Send an HTTP GET Request: Send a properly formatted HTTP GET request to the server.
# 5. Receive the Response: Continuously receive data from the server until thereâ€™s no more data.
# 6. Close the Socket: Close the socket connection.
# 7.Print the Response: Decode and print the response.
